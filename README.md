# Overview
This is a quick proof-of-concept script that uses Puppeteer (https://pptr.dev/) to navigate to a URL, perform a screenshot, download the HAR file, and log any network errors.
- "The specification for the HTTP Archive (HAR) format defines an archival format for HTTP transactions that can be used by a web browser to export detailed performance data about web pages it loads" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAR_(file_format)

# Future work
The objective is to create an automated QA tool that can execute Puppeteer actions automatically log errors, capture screenshots, and other relevant information as part of a CI/CD process.
